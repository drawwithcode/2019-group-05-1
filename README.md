<h3> Project Idea </h3> 

Every day we hear about climate change and the enormous impact that it has on the oceanâ€™s wildlife. Working together and with a small effort, we can all contribute to changing the conditions of our oceans.<br>
With this interactive web space people from all over the world can collaborate in doing it. Marinence is a web experience realized by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, an hospital and rehab center for the endagered species in the ocean. 
Pretending that we could see the ocean like an aquarium the users have to cover with their cursor the cracks that appear on the screen in order to save the fishes. Each repaired crack represents one dollar donated from Clearwater to the protection of the oceans. The fishes represented on the page are endangered species that few people know of. <br> 
People are asked to work together and the experience demonstrates how each one of us can contribute to a greater good. 

<h3> Design Challenges </h3>

<h3> Code Challenges </h3>

Creating a crack that could only be solved using multiple cursors was one of the main challenges
